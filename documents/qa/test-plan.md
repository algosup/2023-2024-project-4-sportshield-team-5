## 1. Introduction

The client contacted us to work on SportShield, the prototype of a lock which will be principally used for the protection of winter sports equipment and needs multiple enhancements. This product targets a wide audience, from people well-acquainted with the concept of securing their equipment to people wanting to protect their occasional rental of equipment and with any experience in this security field.

This project aims to enhance the inner workings of SportShield from a software point of view, using C++ and the given hardware. The primary objective is to detect shocks and distinguish theft attempts from unintentional bumps into the sports equipment protected by the lock, as well as triggering an alarm if a theft is detected. The second objective is to enhance battery usage while adding the possibility of doing concurrent actions on the lock and offering NFC unlocking.

With these objectives, the product aims to serve as an educational tool for learning C++ language but also to help the client in their product prototyping. Given the specificity of SportShield, the lock's software must be fully tested ensuring it is bug-free.

The Test Plan has been created to facilitate within the team members. This document describes approaches and methodogies that will apply to the [types of testing] testing of SportShield. It includes [categories]. This document also identifies the test deliverables and the scope of this testing.

## 2. Quality Objectives

### 2.1 Primary Objectives

List primary objectives

### 2.2 Secondary Objectives

List secondary objectives

## 3. Scope of Testing

The testing of SportShield will mainly consist of the validation of the core features asked by the client, but also of the system resilience in extreme conditions ensuring this lock is a reliable piece of winter sports equipment. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the hardware will not be tested, as these objectives are beyond the scope of this testing.

### 3.1 In Scope

- Documents
  - Spellchecking
  - Vocabulary accuracy
  - Ambiguities
  - Consistency between documents
- Code
  - Absence of significant bugs
  - Final product meets the KPIs and reliability indicators given by CORIS Innovation
  - Conventions respect

### 3.2 Out of Scope

- Hardware-related issues

## 1. Product Analysis

### 1.1. Overview

This project aims to enhance the inner workings of a lock, called SportShield, which will be principally used in the world of sports, using C++. The primary objective is to detect shocks and distinguish theft attempts from unintentional bumps into the sports equipment protected by the lock.

This project targets a wide audience, from people well-acquainted with the concept of securing their equipment to people wanting to protect their occasional rental and without any experience in this security field. With these objectives, the product aims to serve as an educational tool for learning C++ language but also to help CORIS Innovation in their product prototyping.
